## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need the following to run this project:

- A local server (XAMPP, WAMP, or MAMP)
- PHP 7.4 or higher
- MySQL database
- Code editor (e.g., VSCode)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/maruf-pfc/green-garden.git
   ```

2. **Move the project to your local server directory:**

   If you're using XAMPP, place the project folder in:

   ```bash
   /opt/lampp/htdocs/green-garden
   ```

3. **Start your local server:**

   Open XAMPP or MAMP and start **Apache** and **MySQL**.

4. **Set up the database:**

   - Open **phpMyAdmin** and create a new database named `green_garden`.
   - Import the `green_garden.sql` file into this database to create the necessary tables.

5. **Install PHPMailer:**

The project uses PHPMailer for sending emails. Install it via Composer with the following command:

```bash
composer require phpmailer/phpmailer:^6.9
```

This will add the following to your composer.json file:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "phpmailer/phpmailer": "^6.9"
    }
}
```

### Running the Project

1. **Access the website:**

   In your web browser, navigate to:

   ```bash
   http://localhost/green-garden
   ```

2. **Test product uploads:**

   You can visit the product upload page at:

   ```bash
   http://localhost/green-garden/product_upload.php
   ```

    To upload a product you have to sign in as an admin. The default admin credentials are:

    - Username: `admin`
    - Password: `admin123`

3. **Database Configuration:**

   Ensure that the `db_connection.php` file contains the correct database credentials:

   ```php
   $host = 'localhost';
   $user = 'root';
   $password = '';
   $dbname = 'green_garden';
   ```

4. **Browse the website:**

   Test all pages, including the home page (`index.php`), about us page (`about.php`), services page (`services.php`), and contact page (`contact.php`).
