# Green Garden Website

Work on upload product feature:

```markdown
If a user go to upload_product page then check if the user is logged in or not. If the user already logged in then show him upload product form where the categories are fetched from database. If the user not logged in then show him a login interface in the same page. Ask him to enter username and password. Fetch the username and password and check it with database admin_user username and password. Don't need to check with the hashed password because we store plain text as admin password on the database. If everything is okay then show him the product_upload form, get the response and insert it to the database table.
```

This project is a website for a gardening service business, offering about us, services, an FAQ section, a contact page, and a product upload feature for gardening products. The website includes database interaction and dynamic content handling.
